Pathfinding Visualization Project


This repository contains a pathfinding visualization project using Flask in the backend for handling pathfinding algorithms, and JavaScript and HTML in the frontend for interactive maze drawing and visualization. The application allows users to draw mazes on the screen using their mouse, select from three different pathfinding algorithms, and visualize the selected algorithm's process.


Introduction

Pathfinding algorithms are essential in various real-world applications, such as GPS navigation, robotics, and game development. This project aims to provide an interactive and visual demonstration of different pathfinding algorithms, allowing users to explore their functionalities and understand how they work in maze-solving scenarios.

The project includes the following main components:

    Backend: Built using Flask, the backend handles requests from the frontend, and executes the selected pathfinding algorithm.

    Frontend: Developed with JavaScript and HTML, the frontend provides an interactive canvas where users can draw mazes with their mouse. It also offers a selection menu to choose from three pathfinding algorithms.

Features

    Interactive maze drawing with mouse support.
    Three popular pathfinding algorithms to choose from: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, and Breadth-First Search (BFS).
    Visualized pathfinding process for better understanding.
    Smooth and responsive user interface.
